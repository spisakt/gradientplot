Package: gradientplot
Title: Plot fMRI activation patterns in gradient space
Version: 0.1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Tamas", "Spisak", email = "tamas.spisak@uk-essen.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The only function in this package is the plotting function 'gradient_plot'. With default parameters it plots activation in the cerebellar gradient-space, as published by Guell et al. (2018, eLife), however it is easy to use it for plotting with other brain gradients (at leasst two). This is a developer version, use with caution.
